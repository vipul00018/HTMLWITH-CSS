            <td> Masala dosa </td>
            <td>Arguably South India’s most renowned culinary export, masala dosas are famous the world over. A sort of Indian pancake, dosas are made from a thin batter consisting of rice, flour and lentils.</td>

            <td> Chaat </td>
            <td>Synonymous with Delhi street food vendors, chaat is one of India’s most delicious savoury snacks. The name derives from three Hindi words meaning ‘a delicacy,’ ‘licking one’s fingers’ and ‘to devour with relish’ and this dish truly does live up to its heritage.</td>
        </tr>
            <td> Vada pav </td>
            <td>Originating in the traditionally vegetarian state of Maharashtra, vada pav is as close as Indian cuisine gets to veggie burgers. One for carb lovers, vada pav consists of a deep fried potato dumpling placed neatly inside a small bun.</td>

        <tr>
            <td> Stuffed paratha </td>
            <td>Punjab’s foodie heritage doesn’t stop at dal makhani. Often eaten at the start of the day, stuffed parathas are seen as the breakfast of champions in northern India. The word paratha derives from the Sanskrit word atta meaning ‘layers of cooked dough,’ and this dish lives up to its moniker</td>

            <td> Dal makhani </td>
            <td>Most foodies will have heard of or tasted dal, but there’s nothing quite like tasting the original dish in the country where it originated from. Dal is the Hindi word for lentils, and this soup-like delicacy is made by stewing small black lentils for hours on end.</td>

            <td> Dhokla </td>
            <td>Hailed as the regional dish of northwest India, the Gujarati delicacy dhokla is a savoury vegetarian snack made of rice and split chickpeas. It’s tastier than it sounds – Gujaratis eat it for breakfast or lunch, and sometimes even as a snack or side dish.</td>
